Hacktoberfest is an annual event that encourages open-source software contributions. It usually takes place throughout the month of October. Organized by DigitalOcean and GitHub, Hacktoberfest is open to developers and contributors from around the world.

Participants in Hacktoberfest are encouraged to make a certain number of pull requests (typically four) to open-source repositories on GitHub during the month of October. These pull requests can involve code contributions, documentation improvements, bug fixes, or other forms of contributions. The idea is to support and celebrate the open-source community by helping projects and repositories with their development and maintenance.

Hacktoberfest is a great opportunity for developers, both new and experienced, to learn more about open-source software, collaborate with other contributors, and make a positive impact on the projects they care about. Participants can also earn rewards, such as t-shirts and swag, for completing the required number of pull requests. It's a fantastic way to engage with the open-source community and give back to the software ecosystem.
